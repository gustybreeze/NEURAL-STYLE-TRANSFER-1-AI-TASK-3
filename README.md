# NEURAL-STYLE-TRANSFER-1-AI-TASK-3
















📌 Overview
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an exciting deep learning technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another to generate a new, visually appealing image. In this task, we implemented a system that uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (e.g., VGG19) to perform this artistic transformation.

This technique demonstrates how neural networks can be used creatively in art generation, image manipulation, and design automation.

🎯 Objective
Understand and apply the concept of style transfer using deep learning.

Use content and style images to create a fused, stylized image.

Leverage a pre-trained model to extract high-level image features.

Implement the optimization loop to minimize style and content loss.

🛠 Tools and Technologies
Python 3.x

TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on implementation)

NumPy

Matplotlib

PIL (Python Imaging Library) or OpenCV

Pre-trained VGG19 model

🚀 How It Works
Input Images:

A content image (e.g., a landscape or a building).

A style image (e.g., a painting by Van Gogh or Picasso).

Feature Extraction:

The model uses a pre-trained VGG19 CNN to extract feature representations of content and style layers.

Loss Calculation:

Content Loss: Difference between content features of the content image and the generated image.

Style Loss: Difference between Gram matrices (correlation of features) of the style image and the generated image.

Optimization:

An iterative optimization (using gradient descent) is performed to adjust the pixels of the generated image to minimize the total loss.

Output:

A new image is generated that preserves the structure of the content image and mimics the style of the reference artwork.
